# findyourhat
Find Your Hat project for CodeCademy.

The goal is to generate a field filled with holes, and the player walks the field in search of a hat. The project requires generating the field with nested arrays, and using the array.join method to make a playable field. The project also uses node's <code>prompt</code> feature to handle user inputs. The project also uses js classes, so that the field is easily changed. My project also allows the player to "re-generate" a new field before playing the game.
